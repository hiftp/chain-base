Accounting cheat sheet
======================

.. h:div:: intro-list

   .. rst-class:: intro-balance

   The **Balance Sheet** is a snapshot of the company's finances at a specific date (as opposed to
   the Profit and Loss, which is an analysis over a period).

   * .. rst-class:: intro-assets

     **Assets** represent the company's wealth and the goods it owns. Fixed assets include buildings
     and offices, while current assets include bank accounts and cash. The money owed by a client is
     an asset. An employee is not an asset.

   * .. rst-class:: intro-liabilities

     **Liabilities** are obligations from past events that the company will have to pay in the
     future (utility bills, debts, unpaid suppliers). Liabilities could also be defined as a source
     of financing which is provided to the company, also called *leverage*.

   * .. rst-class:: intro-equity

     **Equity** is the amount of the funds contributed by the owners of the company (founders or
     shareholders) plus previously retained earnings (or losses). Each year, net profits (or losses)
     may be reported as retained earnings or distributed to the shareholders (as a dividend).

What is owned (an asset) has been financed through debts to reimburse (liabilities) or equity
(profits, capital).

A difference is made between **assets** and **expenses**:
   - An **asset** is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation, or country owns
     or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit. Assets are reported on
     a company's balance sheet. They are bought or created to increase a firm's value or benefit its
     operations.
   - An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to generate revenues.

.. h:div:: intro-list

   .. rst-class:: intro-p-l

    The **profit and loss** (P&L) report shows the company's performance over a specific period of
    time, usually a quarter or a fiscal year.

     * .. rst-class:: intro-gross-profit

         The **revenue** refers to the money earned by the company by selling goods and/or services.

     * .. rst-class:: intro-gross-profit

         The **cost of goods sold** (COGS, or also known as "Cost of Sale") refers to the sale of
         goods' costs (e.g., the cost of the materials and labor used to create the goods).

       * .. rst-class:: intro-gross-profit

         The **Gross profit** equals the revenues from sales minus the cost of goods sold.

       * .. rst-class:: intro-opex

         **Operating expenses** (OPEX) include administration, sales and R&D salaries, rent and
         utilities, miscellaneous costs, insurances, and anything beyond the costs of products sold
         or the cost of sale.

Chart of accounts
=================

The **chart of accounts** lists all the company's accounts: both Balance sheet accounts and P&L
accounts. Every transaction is recorded by debiting and crediting multiple accounts in a journal
entry. In a way, a chart of accounts is like a company's DNA!

Every account listed in the chart of accounts belongs to a specific category. In Odoo, each account
has a unique code and belongs to one of these categories:

- **Equity and subordinated debts**
     - **Equity** is the amount of money invested by a company's shareholders to finance the
       company's activities.
     - **Subordinated debts** are the amount of money lent by a third party to a company to finance
       its activities. In the event of the dissolution of a company, these third parties are
       reimbursed before the shareholders.
- **Fixed assets** are tangible (i.e., physical) items or properties that a company purchases and
  uses to produce its goods and services. Fixed assets are long-term assets. This means the assets
  have a useful life of more than one year. They also include properties, plants, and equipments
  (also known as "PP&E") and are recorded on the balance sheet with that classification.
- **Current assets and liabilities**
     - The **current assets** account is a balance sheet line item listed under the Assets section,
       which accounts for all company-owned assets that can be converted to cash within one year.
       Current assets include cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, stock inventory,
       marketable securities, prepaid liabilities, and other liquid assets.
     - **Current liabilities** are a company's short-term financial obligations due within one year.
       An example of a current liability is money owed to suppliers in the form of accounts payable.
- **Bank and cash accounts**
     - A **bank account** is a financial account maintained by a bank or other financial institution
       in which the financial transactions between the bank and a customer are recorded.
     - A **cash account**, or cash book, may refer to a ledger in which all cash transactions are
       recorded. The cash account includes both the cash receipts and the cash payment journals.
- **Expenses and income**
     - An **expense** is the costs of operations a company bears to generate revenues. It is simply
       defined as the cost one is required to spend on obtaining something. Common expenses include
       supplier payments, employee wages, factory leases, and equipment depreciation.
     - The term "**income**" generally refers to the amount of money, property, and other transfers
       of value received over a set period of time in exchange for services or products.

Journal entries
===============

Every financial document of the company (e.g., an invoice, a bank statement, a pay slip, a capital
increase contract) is recorded as a journal entry, impacting several accounts.

For a journal entry to be balanced, the sum of all its debits must be equal to the sum of all its
credits.

.. _accounting/reconciliation:

Reconciliation
==============

:doc:`Reconciliation <../../accounting/bank/reconciliation>` is the process of linking
journal items of a specific account and matching credits and debits.

Its primary purpose is to link payments to their related invoices to mark them as paid. This is done
by doing a reconciliation on the accounts receivable account and/or the accounts payable account.

Reconciliation is performed automatically by the system when:

- the payment is registered directly on the invoice
- the links between the payments and the invoices are detected at the bank matching process

Bank Reconciliation
===================

Bank reconciliation is the matching of bank statement lines (provided by your bank) with
transactions recorded internally (payments to suppliers or from customers). For each line in a bank
statement, it can be:

- **matched with a previously recorded payment**: a payment is registered when a check is received
  from a customer, then matched when checking the bank statement.
- **recorded as a new payment**: the payment's journal entry is created and reconciled with the
  related invoice when processing the bank statement.
- **recorded as another transaction**: bank transfer, direct charge, etc.

Odoo should automatically reconcile most transactions; only a few should need manual review. When
the bank reconciliation process is finished, the balance on the bank account in Odoo should match
the bank statement's balance.

.. rst-class:: checks-handling

Checks Handling
===============

There are two approaches to managing checks and internal wire transfers:

- Two journal entries and a reconciliation
- One journal entry and a bank reconciliation

.. h:div:: doc-aside

   The first journal entry is created by registering the payment on the
   invoice. The second one is created when registering the bank statement.
