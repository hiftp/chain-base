Payments
========

In Odoo, payments can either be linked automatically to an invoice or bill or be stand-alone records
for use at a later date.

If a payment is **linked to an invoice or bill**, it reduces the amount due of the invoice. You can
have multiple payments related to the same invoice.

If a payment is **not linked to an invoice or bill**, the customer has an outstanding credit with
your company, or your company has an outstanding debit with a vendor. You can use those outstanding
amounts to reduce unpaid invoices/bills.

Registering payment from an invoice or bill
===========================================

When clicking on :guilabel:`Register payment` in a customer invoice or vendor bill, it generates a
new journal entry and changes the amount due according to the amount of the payment. The counterpart
is reflected in an outstanding receipts or payments account. At this point, the customer invoice or
vendor bill is marked as :guilabel:`In payment`. Then, when the outstanding account is reconciled
with a bank statement line, the invoice or vendor bill changes to the :guilabel:`Paid` status.

The information icon near the payment line displays more information about the payment. You can
access additional information, such as the related journal, by clicking on :guilabel:`View`.

.. note::
   - The customer invoice or vendor bill should be in the status :guilabel:`Posted` to register the
     payment.
   - When clicking on :guilabel:`Register payment`, you can select the amount to pay and make a
     partial or full payment.
   - If your main bank account is set as :ref:`outstanding account
     <bank/outstanding-accounts>`, and the payment is made in Odoo (not related to a
     bank statement), invoices and bills are directly registered in the status :guilabel:`Paid`.
   - If you unreconciled a payment, it still appears in your books but is no longer linked to the
     invoice.
   - If you (un)reconcile a payment in a different currency, a journal entry is automatically
     created to post the currency exchange gains/losses (reversal) amount.
   - If you (un)reconcile a payment and an invoice having cash basis taxes, a journal entry is
     automatically created to post the cash basis tax (reversal) amount.

Registering payments not tied to an invoice or bill
===================================================

When a new payment is registered via the menu :menuselection:`Customers / Vendors --> Payments`, it
is not directly linked to an invoice or bill. Instead, the account receivable or the account payable
are matched with the outstanding account until they are manually matched with their related invoice
or bill.

Matching invoices and bills with payments
-----------------------------------------

A blue banner appears when you validate a new invoice or bill and there is an outstanding payment
for this specific customer or vendor. It can easily be matched from the invoice or the bill by
clicking on :guilabel:`ADD` under :guilabel:`Outstanding Credits` or :guilabel:`Outstanding Debits`.

The invoice or bill is now marked as :guilabel:`In payment` until it is reconciled with the bank
statement.

Batch payment
-------------

Batch payments allow you to group different payments to ease :doc:`reconciliation
<bank/reconciliation>`. They are also useful when you deposit checks to the bank or
for SEPA Payments. To do so, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Customers --> Batch Payments` or
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Vendors --> Batch Payments`. In the list view of payments, you can
select several payments and group them in a batch by clicking on :menuselection:`Action --> Create
Batch Payment`.

Payments matching
-----------------

The :guilabel:`Payments matching` tool opens all unreconciled customer invoices or vendor bills and
gives you the opportunity to process them all one by one, doing the matching of all their payments
and invoices at once. You can reach this tool from the :menuselection:`Accounting Dashboard -->
Customer Invoices / Vendor Bills`, and click on :guilabel:`â‹®` and select :guilabel:`Payments
Matching`, or by going to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reconciliation`.

.. note::
   During the :doc:`reconciliation <bank/reconciliation>`, if the sum of the debits
   and credits does not match, there is a remaining balance. This either needs to be reconciled at a
   later date or needs to be written off directly.

Batch payments matching
-----------------------

To reconcile several outstanding payments or invoices at once, for a specific customer or vendor,
the batch reconciliation feature can be used. Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Reporting -->
Aged Receivable / Aged Payable`. You now see all transactions that have not been reconciled yet, and
when you select a customer or vendor, the :guilabel:`Reconcile` option is displayed.

   :alt: See the reconcile option

Reconciling payments with bank statements
=========================================

Once a payment has been registered, the status of the invoice or bill is :guilabel:`In payment`. The
next step is to reconcile it with the related bank statement line to have the transaction finalized
and the invoice or bill marked as :guilabel:`Paid`.
