Group payments
==============

To register the payment of multiple bills at once, go to :menuselection:`Accounting app -->
Vendors --> Bills`. Then, select the bills you wish to register a payment for by **ticking** the
boxes next to the bills. When done, either click :guilabel:`Register Payment` or

.. note::
   Payments can only be registered for :guilabel:`posted` bills.

When registering the payments, a **pop-up window** appears. From here, you can either create
**separate payments** for each bill all at once by clicking :guilabel:`Create Payment`, *or* create
one payment by combining **all** bills' payments. To **combine** all payments, tick the
:guilabel:`Group Payments` box.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Group Payments` option only appears when selecting two or more bills.

When selecting :guilabel:`Group Payments`, the :guilabel:`amount, currency, date and memo` are all
set automatically, but you can modify them according to your needs.
