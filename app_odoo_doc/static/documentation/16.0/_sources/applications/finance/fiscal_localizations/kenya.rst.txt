Kenyan TIMS integration
=======================

The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has decided to go digital for tax collection through the **Tax
Invoice Management System (TIMS)**. As of December 1st, 2022, all VAT-registered persons should
comply with TIMS. The goal is to reduce VAT fraud, increase tax revenue, and increase VAT compliance
through standardization, validation, and transmission of invoices to KRA on a real-time or near
real-time basis.

All VAT-registered taxpayers should use a **compliant tax register**. Odoo decided to develop the
integration of the **Tremol G03 Control Unit (type C)**, which can be run locally through USB. This
device validates invoices to ensure financial documents meet the new regulations and send the
validated tax invoices directly to KRA. Installing a proxy server that provides a gateway between
users and the internet is required.

Installing the proxy server on a Windows device
-----------------------------------------------

Go to `odoo.com/download <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>`_, fill out the required information
and click :guilabel:`Download`.

Once it is loaded on your computer, a wizard opens. You have to read and agree with the terms of the
agreement. On the next page, select the :guilabel:`type of install: Odoo IoT`. Then, click
:guilabel:`Next` and :guilabel:`Install`. Once completed, click :guilabel:`Next`. Check the
:guilabel:`Start Odoo` box to be redirected to Odoo automatically, and then click :guilabel:`Finish`.

A new page opens, confirming your :doc:`IoT Box <../../productivity/iot/config/connect>` is up and
running. Connect your physical device **Tremol G03 Control Unit (type C)** to your laptop via USB.
In the :guilabel:`IoT Device` section, check that your Tremol G03 Control Unit (type C) appears,
confirming the connection between the device and your computer.

   in the top right corner.

   :doc:`Connect an IoT box to your database <../../productivity/iot/config/connect>`

Sending the data to KRA using the Tremol G03 Control Unit
---------------------------------------------------------

As a pre-requisite, check out that the :ref:`Kenyan Accounting modules
<localization/kenya/configuration>` are installed on your database. Then, go to
:menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Settings --> Kenya TIMS Integration section`, and
check that the :guilabel:`control Unit Proxy Address` matches the address of the IoT box.

To send data to KRA, create a new invoice by going to :menuselection:`Accounting Dashboard -->
Customer Invoice card` and clicking :guilabel:`New Invoice`. Upon confirmation of a new invoice, the
:guilabel:`Send invoice to Fiscal Device` button appears. Clicking on it sends the invoice details
to the device and from the device to the government. The :guilabel:`CU Invoice Number` field is now
completed in your invoice, confirming the information has been sent.

The :guilabel:`Tremol G03 Fiscal Device` tab contains fields that are automatically completed once
the invoice is sent to the government:

- :guilabel:`CU QR Code`: Url from the KRA portal which reflects a QR code.
- :guilabel:`CU Serial Number`: reflects the serial number of the device.
- :guilabel:`CU Signing Date and Time`: The date and time when the invoice has been sent to KRA.

If you click on :guilabel:`Send and Print`, a .pdf of the invoice is generated. The
:guilabel:`Kenyan Fiscal Device Info` is mentioned on the document.

.. note::
   To verify KRA has received the invoice information, take the :guilabel:`CU Invoice Number` and
   and enter it in the :guilabel:`Invoice Number Checker` section on
   `Kenya Revenue Authority website <https://itax.kra.go.ke/KRA-Portal>`_. Click
   :guilabel:`Validate` and find the invoice details.
