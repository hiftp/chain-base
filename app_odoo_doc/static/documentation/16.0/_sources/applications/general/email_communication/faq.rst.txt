FAQ
===

This document contains an explanation of the most recurring mailing concerns.

We will start by addressing issues of outgoing emails (ex: my client has not received my email),
and then, of incoming emails (ex: I do not receive responses from my customers in the database).

Outgoing emails
===============

.. _red_envelop:

What do you have to check if your email is not sent?
----------------------------------------------------

The first indicator showing you that the email has not been sent is the red envelope next to the
date and time of the message.

Common error messages

.. _email_communication/daily_limit_mail:

You reached your daily limit:
*****************************

.. image:: faq/email-limit.png

   :alt: Warning in Odoo upon email limit reached

Each email service provider has its own email sending limits. The limits may be daily, hourly,
and sometimes even per minute. This is the same for Odoo, we have to limit our customers to prevent
our e-mail servers from being blacklisted.

Here are the default limits for new databases:

- 200 emails/day for Odoo Online and Odoo.sh databases with an active subscription,

- 50 emails/day for one-app free and trial databases,

- in case of migration, your daily limit might be reset to 50 emails a day.

In case you hit the limit, you can:

- Ask our support team to increase your daily limit. We will analyze the situation of your database
  depending on (non-exhaustive list):

  - How many users in your database,
  - Which apps are installed,
  - Your bounce rate: the percentage of email addresses that did not receive your emails because
    it was returned by a mail server on its way to the final recipient. You can contact the `support
    <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_.

- Use your own outgoing email server to be independent of Odoo’s mail limit (please refer
  to :doc:`the corresponding documentation </applications/general/email_communication/email_servers>`),
- Wait until 11pm UTC for the reset and click on the retry button: The :ref:`Developer mode <developer-mode>`
  must be activated. Then, go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Emails`

.. warning::
   The daily limit is global to your database and can rise quickly! By default an internal message,
   a notification, a note, etc. counts as an email in your daily limit if it notifies someone.

You can mitigate this by receiving your :ref:`notifications in Odoo <discuss_app/notification_preferences>`
instead of by emails.

SMTP Error
**********

You can find out why an email wasn't transmitted successfully by reviewing the Simple Mail
Transport Protocol (SMTP) error messages. SMTP is a protocol to describe the email structure
and transmit it over the Internet, and the error messages generated by email services are helpful
tools to diagnose and troubleshoot email problems.

No Error
********

Odoo is not always capable of providing information for the reason it failed. The different
providers implement a personalized policy of the bounce emails and it is not always possible
for Odoo to interpret it correctly.

If you have this problem on a recurring basis with the same client or the same domain, please
do not hesitate to contact `Odoo Support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_ for help in finding a reason.

Note: in such case, one of the most common reasons is related to :ref:`SPF <email_communication/spf_compliant>`
and/or :ref:`DKIM <email_communication/DKIM_compliant>` configuration.

Why is my email sent late?
**************************

It may happen that you schedule an email campaign but it is not sent on time. We know that
we use a delayed job to send emails that we consider as not urgent (Newsletters concept
such as mass mailing, marketing automation, events). The system utility **cron** can be used
to schedule programs to run automatically at predetermined intervals. We use that policy in order
to avoid cluttering the mail servers and prioritize the communication.

The emails considered urgent (communication from one person to another one such as
Sales Orders, Invoices, Purchase Orders, etc.) are sent directly.

.. image:: faq/email-scheduled-later.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Email scheduled to be sent later.

By default, the Mass Mailing cron runs every 60 minutes. So, you should wait maximum an hour
before the campaign is actually sent.

Incoming emails
===============

When you have an issue with incoming emails, there might not be an indication per se in Odoo.
This is the client who tries to contact a database who will get a bounce (most of the
time 550: mailbox unavailable).

Emails are not received
-----------------------

Depending on the platform you are using:

- The **Odoo.sh** users can find their live logs on the folder :file:`~/logs/`.

- The folder :file:`~/logs/` (preferably accessed by the command line) of an Odoo.sh contains
  a list of files containing the logs of the database. The log files are created everyday
  at 5:00 AM UTC. The two last days are not compressed, while the older ones are, in order
  to gain space. The naming of the files for Today and Yesterday are :file:`odoo.log` and
  :file:`odoo.log.1`. For the following, they are named with their dates and compressed.
  See the Odoo.sh documentation about :ref:`logs <odoosh/logs>`. Use the command ``grep`` and
  ``zgrep`` (for the compressed ones) to search through the files.

- **Odoo Online** users won’t have access to their logs. However you can still contact
  `Odoo Support <https://www.odoo.com/help>`_ , if you have a recurring issue
  with the same client or domain.

Get help from support
---------------------

In order to get helped efficiently, please provide as much information as possible. Here is a list
of what can be helpful:

- The **EML** of the email, stating for *Electronic Mail*, is the file format containing all the
  technical information required for an investigation. The documentation of your own email provider
  might help you on how to get your EML files. Once you get the EML of the email, adding it
  in the attachment of your ticket is the most efficient way for us to investigate. The support
  will mainly focus on redundant issues.

  .. seealso::
     - `Gmail documentation
       <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436>`_
     - `Outlook documentation
       <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-internet-message-headers-in-outlook-cd039382-dc6e-4264-ac74-c048563d212c#tab=Web>`_

- The exact flow you are following in order to normally receive those emails in Odoo. Here are
  examples of questions whose answers can be useful:

  - Is this simply a reply from an email going out from Odoo ?

  - Are you using an incoming email server or somehow redirecting?

  - Can you provide us with an example of an email that has been correctly forwarded ?

- Providing answers to the following questions:

  - Is it a generic issue or is it specific to a use case? If yes, which one exactly?

  - Is it working as expected? In case the email is sent using Odoo, the bounce email should reach
    the Odoo database and display the :ref:`red envelope <red_envelop>`.
