Reordering rules
================

Reordering rules are used to keep forecasted stock levels above a certain threshold without
exceeding a specified upper limit. This is accomplished by specifying a minimum quantity that stock
should not fall below and a maximum quantity that stock should not exceed.

Reordering rules can be configured for each product based on the route used to replenish it. If a
product uses the *Buy* route, then a Request for Quotation (RFQ) is created when the reordering rule
is triggered. If a product uses the *Manufacture* route, then a Manufacturing Order (MO) is created
instead. This is the case regardless of the selected replenishment route.

Configure products for reordering rules
=======================================

In order to use reordering rules for a product, it must first be correctly configured. Begin by
navigating to :guilabel:`Inventory --> Products --> Products`, then select an existing product, or
create a new one by clicking :guilabel:`Create`.

First, on the :guilabel:`General Information` tab, make sure that the :guilabel:`Product Type` is
set to :guilabel:`Storable Product`. This is necessary because Odoo only tracks stock quantities for
storable products, and this number is used to trigger reordering rules.

Next, click on the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab and select one or more routes from the
:guilabel:`Routes` section. Doing so tells Odoo which route to use to replenish the product.

If the product is reordered using the :guilabel:`Buy` route, confirm that the :guilabel:`Can be
Purchased` checkbox is enabled under the product name. This makes the :guilabel:`Purchase` tab
appear. Click on the :guilabel:`Purchase` tab, and specify at least one vendor, and the price that
they sell the product for, so that Odoo knows which company the product should be purchased from.

If the product is replenished using the :guilabel:`Manufacture` route, it needs to have at least one
Bill of Materials (BoM) associated with it. This is necessary because Odoo only creates
manufacturing orders for products with a :abbr:`BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

If a :abbr:`BoM (Bill of Materials)` does not already exist for the product, select the
:guilabel:`Bill of Materials` smart button at the top of the product form, then click
:guilabel:`Create` to configure a new :abbr:`BoM (Bill of Materials)`.

Create new reordering rules
===========================

To create a new reordering rule, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration -->
Reordering Rules`, then click :guilabel:`Create`, and fill out the new line as follows:

- :guilabel:`Product`: The product that is replenished by the rule.
- :guilabel:`Location`: The location where the product is stored.
- :guilabel:`Min Quantity`: The minimum quantity that can be forecasted without the rule being
  triggered. When forecasted stock falls below this number, a replenishment order for the product is
  created.
- :guilabel:`Max Quantity`: The maximum quantity that stock is replenished up to.
- :guilabel:`Multiple Quantity`: Specify if the product should be replenished in batches of a
  certain quantity (e.g., a product could be replenished in batches of 20).
- :guilabel:`UoM`: The unit of measure used for reordering the product. This value can simply be
  `Units` or a specific unit of measurement for weight, length, etc.

.. tip::
   Reordering rules can also be created from each product form. To do so, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Inventory --> Products --> Products`, then select a product. Click on
   :menuselection:`Reordering Rules --> Create`, then fill out the new line as detailed above.

Once a reordering rule has been created for a product, if its forecasted quantity is below the
rule's minimum quantity when the scheduler runs, a replenishment order for the product is
automatically generated. By default, the scheduler runs once each day.

.. tip::
   To manually trigger a reordering rule before the scheduler runs, select :menuselection:`Inventory
   --> Operations --> Run Scheduler`. Then, select the green :guilabel:`Run Scheduler` button on the
   pop-up that appears. Be aware that this also triggers any other scheduled actions.

If the :guilabel:`Buy` route is selected, then an :abbr:`RFQ (Request for Quotation)` is generated.
To view and manage :abbr:`RFQs (Requests for Quotation)`, navigate to :menuselection:`Purchase -->
Orders --> Requests for Quotation`.

If the :guilabel:`Manufacture` route is selected, then an :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` is
generated. To view and manage :abbr:`MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`, navigate to
:menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`.

Set a preferred route for reordering
====================================

Odoo allows for multiple routes to be selected under the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab on each product
form. For instance, it is possible to select both :guilabel:`Buy` and :guilabel:`Manufacture`, thus
enabling the functionality of both routes.

Odoo also enables users to set a preferred route for a product's reordering rule. This is the route
that the rule defaults to if multiple are selected. To select a preferred route, begin by navigating
to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Reordering Rules`.

By default, the :guilabel:`Preferred Route` column is hidden on the :guilabel:`Reordering Rules`
page. Enable it by selecting the :guilabel:`â‹® (three-dot)` option button on the right side of the
page and checking the :guilabel:`Preferred Route` checkbox. Doing so reveals the
:guilabel:`Preferred Route` column.

Click inside of the column on the row of a reordering rule and a drop-down menu shows all available
routes for that rule. Select one to set it as the preferred route.

.. important::
   If multiple routes are enabled for a product but no preferred route is set for its reordering
   rule, the product is reordered using the selected route that is listed first on the
   :guilabel:`Inventory` tab of the product form.
