Process receipts and deliveries in one step
===========================================

.. _inventory/receipts_delivery_one_step:

By default, incoming shipments are configured to be received directly into stock, and outgoing
shipments are configured to be delivered directly from stock to the customer; the default setting
for warehouses in Odoo is one step receipts and deliveries.

.. note::
   Incoming and outgoing shipments do not need to be configured with the same steps. For example,
   products can be received in one step, but shipped in three steps.

In the following example, one step will be used for both receipts and deliveries.

Configure the warehouse
=======================

If another receiving or shipping configuration is set on the warehouse, they can easily be set back
to the one step setting.

Begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Warehouses`, and click on the
desired warehouse to edit. Next, on the :guilabel:`Warehouse Configuration` tab, under the
:guilabel:`Shipments` section, select :guilabel:`Receive goods directly (1 step)` for
:guilabel:`Incoming Shipments` and/or :guilabel:`Deliver goods directly (1 step)` for
:guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments`.
