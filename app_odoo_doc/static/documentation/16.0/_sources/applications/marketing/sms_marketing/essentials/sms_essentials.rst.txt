SMS essentials
==============

Utilizing :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` outreach in communication strategies can help
companies expand their market reach, especially in some countries, where emails might not be very
common, or even used at all.

Odoo's *SMS Marketing* application can also help boost conversion rates around valuable actions,
such as event registrations, free trials, purchases, etc., since text and mobile-based marketing
channels typically yield higher :abbr:`CTOR (click-to-open rate)` and :abbr:`CTR (click-through
rate)` outcomes.

SMS marketing dashboard
=======================

When the application is opened, Odoo displays the main :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` dashboard, which
showcases the various SMS mailings that have been created, along with pertinent information and data
related to that specific message.

The :guilabel:`Kanban` view is the default Odoo uses when the application is opened, which provides
an organized display of the SMS mailings that have been created, and what their current status is at
the moment.

.. note::
   An :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` mailing can have one of the following statuses:
   :guilabel:`Draft`, :guilabel:`In Queue`, :guilabel:`Sending`, or :guilabel:`Sent`.

In the upper right corner of the main :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` dashboard, there are a few different
view options to choose from. Each one provides a unique take on the same SMS information.

The :guilabel:`List` view provides the same useful data related to SMS mailings, but in a more
traditional list layout.

The :guilabel:`Calendar` view provides a simple calendar, making it easy to see when SMS mailings
are going to be sent (or have been sent). If a future date is clicked, Odoo reveals a blank SMS
template that, when completed, will be scheduled to be sent on that specific future date.

Lastly, the :guilabel:`Graph` view visualizes that same SMS-related data in series of graphs and
charts. Odoo also provides various ways to sort and group the data for more detailed analysis.

Create SMS messages
===================

To start, click :guilabel:`Create` on the main :guilabel:`SMS Marketing` dashboard, and Odoo reveals
a blank SMS template form, which can be configured in a number of different ways.

   :alt: Creating an SMS marketing template.

First, give the mailing a :guilabel:`Subject`, which describes what the mailing is about.

Next, in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, choose to whom this :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)`
will be sent. By default, Odoo has :guilabel:`Mailing List` selected. If this is the desired
:guilabel:`Recipients` field option, specify which mailing list Odoo should send this :abbr:`SMS
(Short Message Service)` to in the :guilabel:`Select Mailing List` field.

.. note::
   To create (or edit) a mailing list, go to :menuselection:`Mailing Lists --> Mailing List`. There,
   Odoo displays all previously created mailing lists, along with various types of data related to
   that specific list (e.g. number of contacts, mailings, recipients, etc.).

   To learn more about mailing lists and contacts, check out
   :doc:`mailing_lists_blacklists`

   :align: center
   :alt: View of the mailing list page in the SMS marketing application.

To reveal all the possible options in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field, click the field to see all
the choices Odoo makes avaialble.

When another field (other than :guilabel:`Mailing List`) is selected, the option to specify that
chosen field even further becomes available — either with a default recipient filter equation that
appears automatically (which can be customized to fit any business need), or, if no default
recipient filter equation is present, an :guilabel:`Add Filter` button will appear.

Clicking the :guilabel:`Add Filter` button, reveals fully customizable domain rule fields, which can
be configured similar to an equation. You can create multiple recipient rules, if necessary.

Then, Odoo will only send the :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` to recipients who fit into
whatever criteria is configured in those fields. Multiple rules can be added.

.. example::
   If :guilabel:`Contact` is chosen, all of the *Contacts* records in the Odoo database (vendors,
   customers, etc.) will receive the :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)`, by default — unless more
   specific recipient rules are entered.

   For instance, the message below will only be sent to contacts in the database that are located in
   the United States (e.g. `Country` > `Country Name` equals `United States`), and they haven't
   blacklisted themselves from any mailings (e.g. `Blacklist` > `is` > `not set`).

Writing SMS messages
--------------------

Enter the content of the :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` in the text field, found in the
:guilabel:`SMS Content` tab. Links and emojis can also be included. Beneath the text field, Odoo
displays how many characters are used in the message, along with how many :abbr:`SMS (Short Message
Service)` mailings it will take to deliver the complete message.

.. tip::
   To check the price of sending an :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` for a country, click on the
   :guilabel:`Information` icon.

.. note::
   Credits must be purchased from Odoo in order to take advantage of the *SMS Marketing* app;
   :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` messages will not be sent without credits.

Track links used in SMS messages
--------------------------------

When links are used in :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` messages, Odoo automatically generates
link trackers to gather analytical data and metrics related to those specific links, which can be
found by going to :menuselection:`Configuration --> Link Tracker`.

Adjust SMS settings
===================

Under the :guilabel:`Settings` tab of the SMS template, there is an option to :guilabel:`Include
opt-out link`. If activated, the recipient is able to unsubscribe from the mailing list, thus
avoiding all future mailings.

An employee can be designated as the :guilabel:`Responsible` in the :guilabel:`Tracking` section of
the :guilabel:`Settings` tab, as well.

Send SMS messages
=================

Once a mailing is created, choose when Odoo should deliver the message from the following options:

- :guilabel:`Send`: sends the message immediately. Consider using this option if the recipient list
  is highly refined, or in cases that involve fast approaching deadlines, such as a "flash sale."
- :guilabel:`Schedule`: choose a day (and time) for Odoo to send the mailing. This is typically the
  best option for mailings related to a specific event. Such a method can also be used to promote a
  limited-time offer, or to help plan a company's content strategy in advance.
- :guilabel:`Test`: allows for an :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` to be sent to one or multiple
  numbers for test purposes. Remember to use a comma between phone numbers if multiple numbers are
  used as recipients.

Visualize reports
=================

On the :guilabel:`Reporting` page (accessible via the :menuselection:`Reporting` option in the
header menu), there are options to apply different combinations of :guilabel:`Filters` and
:guilabel:`Measures` to view metrics in a number of different layouts (e.g. :guilabel:`Graph`,
:guilabel:`List`, and :guilabel:`Cohort` views.)

Each :guilabel:`Reporting` metric view option allows for more extensive performance analysis of
:abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` mailings.

For example, while in the default :guilabel:`Graph` view, :abbr:`SMS (Short Message Service)` data
is visualized as different graphs and charts, which can be sorted and grouped in various ways (e.g.
:guilabel:`Measures` drop down menu).
