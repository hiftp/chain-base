**Odoo Knowledge** is a multipurpose productivity app that allows internal users to enrich their
business knowledge base and provide individually or collaboratively gathered information.

The pages on which they gather content are called *articles*. They are mainly composed of a title
and a body. The latter is an HTML field containing text, images, links to other articles, records
from other models, templates, etc.
