Mail Plugins are connectors that bridge your mailbox with your Odoo database. With them, you can
interact with your Odoo database directly from your mailbox by:

- Creating leads and centralizing prospects' emails into the CRM app.
- Generating tasks in any Odoo project.
- Creating tickets in the Helpdesk app.
- Searching and storing insights on your contacts.

Mail Plugins are available for :doc:`Outlook <mail_plugins/outlook>` and :doc:`Gmail
<mail_plugins/gmail>`.

Pricing
=======

Mail Plugins are **free** to install and use.

However, they can provide **Lead Enrichment**, which is part of a paid service known as **Lead
Generation**.

Mail plugins allow you to test Lead Enrichment for free, whether you connect the plugins to a
database or not. After a while, the plugins ask you to buy :doc:`../general/in_app_purchase`
credits if you would like to keep using this service.
