PDF reports
===========

With Studio, you can edit existing PDF reports (e.g., orders and quotations) or create new ones.

.. important::
   To edit a standard PDF report, it is strongly recommended to **duplicate** it and make changes to
   the duplicated version, as changes made to standard reports will be overwritten after an Odoo
   upgrade. To duplicate a report, go to :menuselection:`Studio --> Reports`. Hover the mouse
   pointer on the top right corner of the report, click the vertical ellipsis icon (:guilabel:`â‹®`),
   and then select :guilabel:`Duplicate`.
