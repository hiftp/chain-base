Automatically get product images with Google Images
===================================================

The product images are very useful in Odoo, for example, to quickly find a product or check if you
scanned the right one, but it can be a bit painful to set up especially if you have a lot of
products. **Google Custom Search** allows finding images automatically for your product, based on
their barcode, keeping your focus on what matters in your business.

.. _product_images/configuration:

Configuration
=============

This functionnality requires configuration both on Google and on Odoo.

With a free Google account, you can get up to 100 free images per day. If you need a higher rate,
you'll have to upgrade to a billing account.

      Once **Search the entire web** is enabled, you can safely delete the site that you put at the
      previous step.
