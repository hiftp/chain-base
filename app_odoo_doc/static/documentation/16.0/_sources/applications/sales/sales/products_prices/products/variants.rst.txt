Product variants
================

Product variants are used to give single products a variety of different characteristics, such as
size and color. Products using variants can be managed at the product template level (for all
attributes and variants of that product), and/or at the variant level (for individual variants).

As an example, a company selling t-shirts may have the following product:

- T-shirt

  - Color: Blue, Red, White, Black
  - Size: S, M, L, XL, XXL

In this example, the **T-Shirt** is the product template, and **T-Shirt, S, Blue** is a product
variant. **Color** and **size** are the attributes. **S** and **Blue** are values.

The above example has a total of 20 different product variants (5 sizes x 4 colors). Each one of
these has its own inventory, sales, etc.

Configuration
=============

Activating product variants
---------------------------

To use product variants, go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Product Catalog`, and enable the :guilabel:`Variants` feature. Finally, click :guilabel:`Save` to
apply the setting.

Creating attributes
-------------------

Attributes need to be created before product variants can be set up. Attributes can be accessed
via :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Products --> Attributes`.

.. note::
   The order of attributes on the :guilabel:`Attributes` page dictates how they appear on the
   :guilabel:`Product Configurator`, :guilabel:`Point of Sale` dashboard, and :guilabel:`eCommerce`
   pages.

To create a new attribute, click :guilabel:`Create`. First, choose an attribute name, such as
"Color" or "Size."

.. image:: variants/attribute-creation.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Attribute creation window.

Then, select a :guilabel:`Display Type`, which determines how this product will be shown on the
:guilabel:`eCommerce` page, :guilabel:`Point of Sale` dashboard, and :guilabel:`Product
Configurator`.

- :guilabel:`Radio`: options appear in a bullet style list.
- :guilabel:`Select`: options appear in a dropdown menu.
- :guilabel:`Color`: options appear as small colored squares, which reflect any HTML color codes
  set.

.. image:: variants/display-types.png

The :guilabel:`Variants Creation Mode` informs Odoo when to automatically create a new variant once
an attribute is added to a product.

- :guilabel:`Instantly`: creates all possible variants as soon as attributes and values are added
  to a product template.
- :guilabel:`Dynamically`: creates variants only when corresponding attributes and values are added
  to a sales order.
- :guilabel:`Never`: never automatically creates variants.

.. note::
   Once added to a product, an attribute's :guilabel:`Variants Creation Mode` cannot be edited.

Values should be added to an attribute before saving, but more values can be added at any time,
if needed. To add a value, click :guilabel:`Add a line`. From there, you can:

#. Type in the value's name.
#. Check a box to indicate whether or not the value is custom (i.e. the customer provides unique
   specifications).
#. Specifically for colors, add an HTML color code to make it even easier for salespeople and
   customers to know what they're selecting.

A color code can be selected either by dragging the slider around or by entering a specific HTML
color code (e.g. #FF0077).

Finally, click :guilabel:`Save` to finish creating the attribute.

.. tip::
   Attributes can also be created directly from the product template by adding a new line and
   typing the name into the :guilabel:`Variants` tab.

After an attribute is added to a product, a new tab appears on the attribute's page called
:guilabel:`Related Products`. This tab lists every product in the database that is currently using
the attribute.

Creating product variants
-------------------------

After creating an attribute, use the attribute to create a product variant by going to
:menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products`. Then, select an existing product and click
:guilabel:`Edit`, or create a new product by clicking :guilabel:`Create`.

The :guilabel:`Variants` smart button at the top of the product template indicates the number of
currently configured variants on the product.

To add a new variant, click on the :guilabel:`Variants` tab, then click on :guilabel:`Add a line`
to add any attributes and values. When all the attributes and values have been added, click
:guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   Similar product variant creation processes are accessible through the Purchase, Inventory, and
   eCommerce applications.

Managing product exclusions
---------------------------

The following examples are all based on a product template that has two attributes:

- T-Shirt

  - Color: Blue, Red, White
  - Size: S, M, L, XL, XXL

With the above product template, there are 15 different t-shirt variants in three different colors
and five different sizes. If the white t-shirts are not available in the XXL size, then that
variant can be deactivated.

To deactivate a particular product variant, go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products`
and select the relevant product. Next, click on the :guilabel:`Configure` button next to the
relevant attribute value. Then select the relevant value (in this example, the :guilabel:`White
Color` attribute), and then click on :guilabel:`Edit`.

In the :guilabel:`Exclude for` section, click :guilabel:`Add a line` and select any product(s)
and/or specific attribute values that are currently unavailable. Finally, click :guilabel:`Save` to
apply the setting, and Odoo will automatically show the product variant as unavailable on the
eCommerce page.

Setting a price per variant
---------------------------

Extra costs can be added to a product's standard price for specific product variants.

To do this, open :menuselection:`Sales --> Products --> Products`, and click on the relevant
product. Next, click on :guilabel:`Configure Variants` to access the list of product variant
values.

Then, click on a variant value, and :guilabel:`Edit`. In the :guilabel:`Value Price Extra` field,
type in the additional cost for this particular value. This amount is added to the standard price.
Finally, click :guilabel:`Save` to apply the extra price to the value.

Impact of variants
==================

- :guilabel:`Barcode`: barcodes are associated with each variant instead of the product template.
  Each individual variant can have its own unique barcode/SKU.

- :guilabel:`Price`: every product variant has its own public price, which is the sum of the
  product template price and any extra charges for particular attributes. For example, a red
  shirt's cost is $23 because the shirt's template price is $20, plus an additional $3 for the red
  color variant. Pricelist rules can be configured to apply to the product template or to the
  variant.

- :guilabel:`Inventory`: inventory is counted for each individual product variant. On the product
  template form, the inventory reflects the sum of all variants, but the actual inventory is
  computed by individual variants.

- :guilabel:`Picture`: each product variant can have its own specific picture.

.. note::
   Changes to the product template automatically apply to every variant of that product.
