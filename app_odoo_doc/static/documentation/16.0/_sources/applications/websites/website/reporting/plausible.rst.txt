.. note::
   - | **You are on the Odoo Online Platform**
     | When you `create your Odoo Online database <https://www.odoo.com/trial>`_, we create it for
       you on our own server. You don't have anything to do.
   - | **What about the Goal?**
     | Odoo pushes out-of-the-box custom events: `Lead Generation` and `Shop`.
