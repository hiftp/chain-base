`Install Git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_. It is a command-line
(:dfn:`a text interface`) tool that allows tracking the history of changes made to a file and, more
importantly, working on different versions of that file simultaneously. It means you do not need to
worry about overwriting someone elseâ€™s pending work when making changes.

Verify that the installation directory of Git is included in your system's `PATH` variable.

      :file:`/usr/bin/git`).
