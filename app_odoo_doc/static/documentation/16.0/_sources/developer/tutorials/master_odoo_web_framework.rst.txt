This tutorial is designed for those who have completed the :doc:`discover_js_framework` tutorial and
are looking to deepen their knowledge of the Odoo web framework.

For this training, we will step into the shoes of the IT staff at the fictional company Awesome
T-Shirt, which is dedicated to printing custom t-shirts for online customers. The Awesome T-Shirt
company uses Odoo to manage orders and has created a dedicated Odoo module to manage their workflow.

In this tutorial, we will explore various aspects of the Odoo web framework in detail, including
fields and views, notifications, command palette, and much more. This tutorial will provide you with
the knowledge and skills you need to take full advantage of the Odoo web framework. So, let's get
started!
